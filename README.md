The front-end portion of the web application has been developed using **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** while the backend portion has been developed using **Flask & SQLite**. The information regarding the users, food items, tables and orders are stored in a database created using **SQLite**. Through the use of **Flask**, the web app interacts with the database. To verify the user's phone number, we have used **Twilio Authy API** and the delivery tracking has been implemented using **Google Maps Javascript API** and **Google Directions API**
